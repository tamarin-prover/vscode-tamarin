How to start using the git repository:

- Run `npm install` in this folder. This installs all necessary npm modules in both the client and server folder. 
- Open VS Code on this folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+D , click on the green arrow in the top left-hand corner and select `npm: watch` (tsc -watch -p./) to start testing your code. It will launch a new window, if it doesn't open then click on "Debug Anyway" on bottom right-hand corner.
- Then in the test window open a Tamarin document (.spthy) and test the code. (There is no need to uninstal tamarin-prover official VsCode extension)
